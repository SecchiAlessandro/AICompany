name: "eu-energy-market-trends"
overview: >
  Comprehensive analysis of European energy market trends. Four specialized research agents
  gather the latest data on electricity & gas prices, renewable energy, fossil fuels & carbon markets,
  and energy demand & policy from public EU sources (Eurostat, IEA, ENTSO-E, ACER, European Commission).
  A fifth compiler agent assembles all research into a single, well-structured Excel workbook
  with multiple sheets, charts, and source citations. Target coverage: 5+ energy categories,
  10+ EU countries, 2024-2025 data points.
