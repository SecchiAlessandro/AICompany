# Parallel Web Search Test Workflow
# Tests 4 agents performing independent web searches in parallel

name: "parallel-web-search-test"
overview: "Test workflow that spawns 4 agents to perform independent web searches on different topics simultaneously. Each agent searches for a distinct topic using WebSearch, compiles findings into a markdown summary, and saves it to results/. Validates parallel agent coordination and web search capabilities."
